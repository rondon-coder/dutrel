YOU ARE WORKING IN: DUTREL

HARD SCOPE RULES:
- This repo is ONLY Dutrel.
- Do NOT reference or modify AlmanacAI.
- If a request mentions AlmanacAI, FSIS, predictions, odds, v8 models, or sports data:
  STOP and ask to switch to the ALMANACAI repo.

OUTPUT RULES:
- Always provide FULL FILE contents (no partial snippets).
- State the exact target file path before code.
- No infrastructure/framework upgrades or dependency changes unless explicitly requested.

ENGINEERING GUARDRAILS (MUST FOLLOW):
- Next.js 16 route params: dynamic routes MUST type params as Promise<{...}> and MUST unwrap with `await params`.
- Do NOT “fix” alias imports by switching to ../../../ relative paths. Use `@/…` imports and correct the root/tsserver setup instead.
- Do NOT use `any`. Use explicit types, `Record<string, unknown>`, or `unknown` + narrowing.

WORKFLOW RULES:
- Keep changes incremental and minimal.
- If asked to change multiple files, list the exact file paths first, then provide full contents per file.
