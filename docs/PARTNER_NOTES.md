# Dutrel — Partner Notes (High level, Phase 1/2)

## Partner posture
- Dutrel Phase 1 is a coordination layer, not a utility replacement.
- No forced funding, no auto-retries, strong audit trails.
- Failure states mirror utility behavior (manual correction after failure/reversal).

## Questions to ask partners (Unit/Dwolla)
- Supported ACH rails and timing (standard vs same-day), and constraints for debits/credits.
- Webhook coverage for returns/NSF/reversals and dispute flows.
- KYC/CIP requirements for wallet or account issuance.
- Limits, fees, and settlement timelines (especially for same-day ACH).
- Requirements for account ownership verification and device/session security.

## Language guidance
- Avoid “AI” claims in money movement contexts.
- Say “analyzes historical bill behavior to recommend buffers” (optional).
